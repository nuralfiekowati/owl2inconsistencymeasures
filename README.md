# owl2inconsistencymeasures
Inconsistency measures for ontologies

There are 15 inconsistency measures which have been implemented here. They are divided into two groups of measures that we call: ontology-based inconsistency measures and axiom-based inconsistency measures, where each of them consists of 10 and 5 measures, respectively. These measures are built for OWL 2 ontologies as the input.
